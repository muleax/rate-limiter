                                  +----------------+

Rate-limiter acts as a reverse proxy, and forward client requests to App service. Each request is expected to come with an API key, wich is used to identify the source.

For each incoming request Rate-limiter makes a Redis transaction of the form:

```
MULTI
    SET <api_key> 0 NX EX <timeout>
    INCR <api_key>
EXEC
```

Here timeout is equal to window size. The entry will be removed later, resetting the count.

Rate-limiter checks the request count for the key and decides whether to forward the request to App service.

## Performance

Test setup:

    |                     |            |  | Rate-limiter |   | App Service |   |   Redis   |  |
    |       Vegeta        |----------->|  |   container  |   |  container  |   | container |  |
    |  (AWS m5zn.xlarge)  |            |  +--------------+   +-------------+   +-----------+  |
    +---------------------+            |                     (AWS m5zn.xlarge)                |
                                       +------------------------------------------------------+

- Window size: 5 seconds
- Limit per window per API key: 3 request
- 20 different API keys
- 50k connections

With such a setup, saturation point occurs around 55k RPS. Note that most requests failed with 429 status, but this is actually expected behavior.
